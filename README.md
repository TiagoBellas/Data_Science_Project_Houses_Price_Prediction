# Data_Science_Project_Houses_Price_Prediction

**Overview**
This is a individual project development in Data Science Pos Degree programm

**Project Context**

An unnamed company provides estimates of house prices to customers. However, the model is maybe not as accurate as it could be and it makes errors in it’s estimates. Project data i have access to an extract of their dataset and a data dictionary to help you understand the column titles. However, i could explore this data for myself, maybe not all of it is useful, some of it is leaking information.
I also needed to clean the data including dealing with null values, different data types, categorical variables, feature engineering and outliers.

**Project Tasks**

Develop a regression model to try to predict the error made by the un-named companies house price estimate. The error is calculated by comparing the predicted price to the actual sale price at the time of the sale (the column “logerror” is the log of this error, so i could try to predict error or logerror).

A. Build the overall “best” regression model to predict the error made by the un-named companies model (“logerror” column). You will need to decide how you define and demonstrate which model is “best”. Comment on any limitations this model might have when used by management for its desired purpose (house price prediction).

B. Determine which features are the most important for detecting errors. Discuss if these make sense.
